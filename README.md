# MessagePack for CLI

## What is it?

This is MessagePack serialization/deserialization for CLI (Common Language Infrastructure) implementations such as .NET Framework, Silverlight, Mono (including Moonlight.)
This library can be used from ALL CLS compliant languages such as C#, F#, Visual Basic, Iron Pyhton, Iron Ruby, PowerShell, C++/CLI or so.

## Usage

You can serialize/deserialize objects as following:
1. Create serializer via `MessagePackSerializer.Create` generic method. This method creates dependent types serializers as well.
1. Invoke serializer as following:
** `Pack` method with destination `Stream` and target object for serialization.
** `Unpack` method with source `Stream`.

```c#
// Creates serializer.
var serializer = MessagePackSerializer.Create<T>();
// Pack obj to stream.
serializer.Pack(stream, obj);
// Unpack from stream.
var unpackedObject = serializer.Unpack(stream);
```

```vb
' Creates serializer.
Dim serializer = MessagePackSerializer.Create(Of T)()
' Pack obj to stream.
serializer.Pack(stream, obj)
' Unpack from stream.
Dim unpackedObject = serializer.Unpack(stream)
```

## Features

* Fast and interoperable binary format serialization with simple API.
* Generating pre-compiled assembly for rapid start up.
* Flexible MessagePackObject which represents MessagePack type system naturally.

## Documentation

See [wiki](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-cli/wiki)

## Installation

* You can get binary drops from NuGet (currently, pre-release only).
  * There are NO distribution packages other than NuGet, so you have to build your own drops for Mono.

## How to build

### For .NET Framework

1. Install recent Windows SDK (at least, .NET Framework 4 Client Profile and MSBuild is needed.) <br/>
   Or install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Express.
    1. If you want to build unit test assemblies, install NuGet and then restore NUnit packages.
2. Run:

    msbuild MsgPack.sln

  Or (for .NET 3.5 drops, Silverlight 4 drops, and Silverlight 5 drops):

    msbuild MsgPack.compats.sln

  Or (for Windows Phone 7.1 drops):

    msbuild MsgPack.wp7.sln

Or open one of above solution files in your IDE and run build command in it.

### For Mono

Open MsgPack.mono.sln with MonoDevelop and then click **Build** menu item.
(Of cource, you can build via xbuild.)
